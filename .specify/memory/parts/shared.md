# Constitution — Shared & cross-cutting part

Authoritative rules for the repo-wide tooling that spans the whole project —
hooks, CI, changelog, and the tool-invocation working-directory rule. Read this
part when your task touches hook/CI config, the changelog, or you need the cwd
rule. Read together with the [constitution](../constitution.md).

## Cross-cutting tooling

- **Hooks**: a shared `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the repo root runs hooks
  across the repo (shellcheck, shfmt, markdownlint, gitleaks, actionlint,
  gitlint). The runner is `prek` — a fast drop-in replacement for the
  `pre-commit` Python package. Hooks MUST remain active; never bypass with
  `--no-verify` (see the constitution's Quality Gates). (Hooks/CI land with the
  tooling; this records the intended shape.)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/check.yml`) reproduces the local
  `make check` (shellcheck + `shfmt -d` + the bats suites) on **macOS and Linux**
  on every pull request.
- **`.docs/` is exempt from document-quality checks.** The living plan/status
  tracker and working notes under `.docs/` are committed frequently as work
  proceeds, so markdownlint and Prettier MUST skip them — see `.markdownlintignore`
  and `.prettierignore` (both list `.docs/`), and the matching `exclude: ^\.docs/`
  in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. A noisy git history under `.docs/` is accepted by
  design. This is the same spirit as the scratch escape-hatch: working artefacts
  are not held to publication standards.
- **Changelog**: `git-cliff` auto-generates from conventional commits. Do not
  hand-maintain `## [Unreleased]` (regenerate via `git cliff --unreleased`).
  Manual edits are limited to released sections for light curation, factual
  corrections, or formatting cleanup. This is the source-code `CHANGELOG.md` —
  separate from the constitution's own version history in
  [`constitution-maintenance.md`](constitution-maintenance.md).

## Tool-invocation working directory

Prefer the tool's built-in cwd flag over `cd <dir> && <tool>`: `git -C <dir>`,
`make -C <dir>`, `gh -R <owner/repo>`. The `cd … && …` form defeats per-command
Bash allowlists (the leading token becomes `cd`, not the wrapped tool), which
triggers permission prompts that stall AI-agent sessions and adds no clarity for
human readers. Inside a script, use a subshell `(cd "${dir}" && …)` or
`pushd`/`popd` to avoid leaking directory state (see [`bash.md`](bash.md)).
